I use the username <em>mniip</em> on most platforms, pronounced /mni&#x02D0;p/.

Professionally, I'm a software developer, but my interests lie in the general trifecta of programming, mathematics, and physics.

I have programmed in too many languages to meaningfully list, but my favorite would be Haskell. I firmly believe in the static analysis approach to software, that programs should be correct by construction. As such I am interested in advanced type systems and proof assistants.

I have a taste for technically sophisticated (and often probably overengineered) solutions to problems with non-standard constraints. This ranges from slick applications of pure functional programming, to esoteric languages, to osdev and embedded.

On the math side of things I am into category theory, type theory, theory of computation, but also functional analysis and quantum information.

You may have heard of me because:
- I run the [largest mathematics Discord server](https://mathematics.gg/).
- I am staff on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/), previously freenode.
- I helped develop [The Powder Toy](https://powdertoy.co.uk), a falling sand sandbox game.
